Codacy Workshop -- DDSS @ DEI 2023

The issues were created via Human-AI(GPT3.5) collaboration.

## Workshop Instructions

* You will be working to resolve all the code issues that Codacy detects
* A branch with issues was already created, make sure you create a branch from it and work on the solutions
* When it's go-time, go to Codacy to see what issues we have prepared for you
  * Codacy link: https://app.codacy.com/gh/codacy-workshop/dei-2023-workshop/dashboard
  * If you can't access the link above, then let us know by raising your hand
* Once you're done (as in, once Codacy says that there all the issues are resolved), let us know by raising your hand
* Good luck!
